# Pick a Roadmap Issue

Read and follow [the shared command](../../../.claude/commands/pick-issue.md)
before starting. That file is the maintained workflow; resolve its relative
links from `.claude/commands/` and run its shell commands from the repository
root.

Treat any issue number or other arguments in the user's invocation as inputs
to the command. Map `openspec-*`, `/code-review`, `/scout` and `/verify-fix`
references to the corresponding available Codex skills. If a referenced
command or skill is unavailable, report that limitation rather than claiming
to have run it.

Apply the current session's instructions and authorization when interpreting
Claude-specific tool or permission notes. Loading this skill alone does not
authorize external actions beyond the user's requested scope.
